# Quadtree image processing

What you get if you split an image into quadrants repeatedly, focusing on the quadrants with the most error compared to the original image.

Some might use this as a form of image compression, but -- *Marge voice* -- I just think they're neat.

Now with animations! These start to 'shimmer' because gifs have a limited color palette. Some other animated format would be better.
Gifs also take a very long time to encode, apparently due to the palette calculations once the image uses more than 256 colors.
